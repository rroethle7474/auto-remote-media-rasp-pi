File Locations:
- Application: /home/rroethle/Desktop/media-player/app.py
- Videos: /home/rroethle/Desktop/media-player/Videos/AndyGriffith/
- Virtual Environment: /home/rroethle/Desktop/media-player/mediaPlayer/bin

CURRENT CHALLENGES:

HDMI/CEC Implementation:
- TV not consistently appearing in CEC bus scan
- Input switching reliability issues
- Need to investigate HDMI configuration

REQUIRED PACKAGES:
- python-vlc
- evdev
- tkinter (usually included with Python)

STARTUP SCRIPTS:
1. start_media_player.sh location:
   /home/rroethle/Desktop/media-player/start_media_player.sh

2. systemd service:
   /etc/systemd/system/media-player.service

NEXT STEPS:
1. Resolve HDMI input switching issues:
   - Test different HDMI ports
   - Verify TV CEC/Anynet+ settings
   - Consider alternative input switching methods

2. Potential Improvements:
   - Add error logging
   - Implement automatic recovery
   - Consider adding volume controls
   - Add show progress indicator

Notes:
- Videos should be numbered 1-100 (.mpg format)
- System designed for simplicity and reliability
- Status screen provides clear user feedback
- Auto-starts on boot for minimal user intervention
